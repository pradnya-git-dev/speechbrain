# Experiment description:
Injecting the embeddings as suggested in FiLM (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.07871.pdf).
Performing a multiplication and a shift..
If h is the hidden representation and e is embeddings:
h_out = f(e) * h + g(e)
Where f and g and learnable transformations (see eq.1 and 2 in the paper).
They can be a linear transformation or a small MLP
